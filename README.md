# Big Cheese

> The Big Cheese is the final evil dentist from
> Monty Python's Secret Service Dentists sketch He is an intimidating man
> with a doctor's mirror headband, a necklace, a leather jacket, black
> gloves, golden rings and a drill attached to his pinky finger riding a
> motorized wheelchair. He shoots his pet rabbit, Floppsy and threatens
> to kill Lemming, Stapleton, LaFarge, Vanderberg, Nurse, and Brian slowly
> and painfully with his drill. Luckily, it happens to be 1:00, so
> everyone leaves for lunch break.
